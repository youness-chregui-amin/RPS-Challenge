## Description

This is a classic *Rock-Paper-Scissors* game where you play against the computer.  
You can choose how many rounds to play, and the program keeps track of the score  
and shows the final winner in color (🟢 Green = Win, 🔴 Red = Lose, 🟡 Yellow = Draw).

This project was developed during the *C++ Problem Solving Course* by *Mohammed Abu Elhoda*,  
as a practical exercise to improve programming logic, loops, enums, and struct usage in C++.
